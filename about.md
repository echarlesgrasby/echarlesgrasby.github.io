# About Me

Like my introduction page says, I'm from Arkansas. I've spent most of my life in and around Central Arkansas, specifically Little Rock. 

## Youth

I had an interesting up-bringing in that I was able to both:

* spend most of my formative years around remnants of "the old world", and
* witness the weird, alien experience that was the decade from 2000 - 2010

## College Days

I attended college right here at a local university (The University of Arkansas at Little Rock) in Little Rock, and earned a B.Sc. in Information Science (IS). Kind of crazy- I didn't really feel like my life had really started before I went to college. It was definitely a place where I came "into my own."

**What is Information Science, you may ask?** The official definition (from Wikipedia) states that it is "an academic field which is primarily concerned with analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval, movement, dissemination, and protection of information." If that reads like a pretty broad definition that doesn't seem very exciting, that's because it is and it's not, respectively. 

In reality, Information Science is very cool. In depth- it is actually a cross-functional study that investigates using data and information (yes, those are two different concepts) to solve problems across all sorts of disciplines. 

The Information Science program at UALR gave me a foundational preparation to enter the workforce, sans much of the confusion and doubt. The modern world is data-centric, and is only becoming more so with each passing year.

However, by far, the most important thing that came out of going to college was meeting a very special woman: Caroline. She and I met during summer orientation before our freshman year at UALR, and by that second semester we had started dating. Fast forward 6 glorious years and we got married (despite the COVID-19 pandemic). 

### Caroline

There is only one word that I can use to describe her: awesome. She's the coolest person that I've ever met, and I'm extremely proud to be her husband. She is an electrical engineer, currently working at a power systems company here in Little Rock.

Here is both of us right after her birthday in 2021:
