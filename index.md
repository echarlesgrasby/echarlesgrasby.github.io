# Eric "Graz" Grasby

## intro
Hello! My name is Eric C. Grasby, and welcome to this small site that I maintain. I'm a Programmer/Analyst currently residing in the American South (Arkansas). I grew up around Little Rock and will be here for the foreseeable future. I have major interests in database and automation development, as well as in linguistics. Feel free to look around this site for anything else that you would like to know. 

## blog
I do also maintain a small blog on this site (thanks to the robust nature of the Sphinx Doc Generator- I'm able to manage this entire site via Markdown). Feel free to peruse it, though many of the posts may seem out of context as I also use it as an online "quick-reference" for myself.
